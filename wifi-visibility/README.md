#### Cloud Wifi Visibility 

Recently I was looking to upgrade my security posture on my home Wi-Fi network. Historically it has been very difficult for me to gain full visibility on all of the devices traffic on my network. Using a Linux ethernet bridge in front of the Wifi router  I was able to see all the outgoing packets, but I wasn't able to identify precisely from which device it had come from easily - mainly because of the fact the wireless router device was doing NAT.

So with a couple of tweaks --  I was able to see all of the traffic, send it to the cloud, and setup an IDS on all the traffic. In addition some other service were setup but for now the main piece is focusing on the overall visibility.


First hereâ€™s a picture of my final config:
